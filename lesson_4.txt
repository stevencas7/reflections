When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working with a team or I want to track my projects from different PCs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In that ways I have a clear control over the changes that I want to public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork. Clone from another Github account directly to my Github account.
Clone. Copy repository from a URL to my PC (local).
Branch. Creates a copy of a branch in the same repository.
