When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working with a team or I want to track my projects from different PCs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In that ways I have a clear control over the changes that I want to public.
