What happens when you initialize a repository?
It creates .git folder.

Why do you need to do it?
To start versioning my folder!

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Sometimes you can do many changes are the same time, that is more than one logical change at the same time.
Then you can sent to the staging area one locical change and commit. Then sent to staging area the next logical change an commit, etc.
Great!
